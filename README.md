# CYCLOPS 2.0
CYCLOPS (Cyclic Ordering by Periodic Structure) is a tool designed to reconstruct the temporal ordering of high dimensional data that is generated by a common periodic process. This module is an improvement to the original CYCLOPS. CYCLOPS 2.0 is written for Julia 1.6. 

## CYCLOPS.jl
This module contains all the code necessary to pre-process data, train CYCLOPS 2.0, and calculate cosinors of best fit for all transcripts using CYCLOPS sample phase predictions.
