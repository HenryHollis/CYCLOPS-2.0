# CYCLOPS 2.0
CYCLOPS (Cyclic Ordering by Periodic Structure) is designed to reconstruct the temporal ordering of high dimensional data generated by a common periodic process. This module is an improvement to the original CYCLOPS. The improved CYCLOPS 2.0 is written for Julia 1.6.  
  
This repository contains two '.jl' files. 'CYCLOPS.jl' contains all the functions necessary to pre-process data, train CYCLOPS 2.0, and calculate cosinors of best fit for all transcripts using CYCLOPS sample phase predictions. 'CYCLOPS_2_0_Template.jl' calls the necessary functions from 'CYCLOPS.jl' to order an expression file, given a list of seed genes and hyperparameters. The 'CYCLOPS_2_0_Template.jl' script is copied and pasted into a terminal running Julia 1.6.  
  
*Please familiarize yourself with the required packages, expression file format, input arguments, and hyperparameters.*

## 3. Expression Data File
The expression data are a required input to the *CYCLOPS.Fit* and *CYCLOPS.Align* functions. The format of the expression data file is as follows:  
  
1. Each column is a sample.
2. Each row is a transcript.
3. The first column of the dataset contains gene symbols and covariate labels (see 'Covariates' and 'Hyperparameters').
4. The first 'k' rows contain covariates and all following rows contain numeric expression data (see 'Covariates').
5. Samples and columns with 'missing' or 'NaN' values should be removed from the dataset.
6. Column names start with letters and only contain numbers, letters, and underscores ('_').
7. All Gene symbols should start with letters.
8. Duplicate gene symbols **are** allowed.
9. Duplicate column names are **NOT** allowed.

```
  
## 4. Seed Genes  
The seed genes are a required input to the *CYCLOPS.Fit* function. Seed genes must be provided as a vector of strings (not symbols). Also consider:  
  
1. Case matters!  
   *"Acot4" in the seed gene list will not match "ACOT4" in the gene symbols of the expression data.*  
2. Provide enough seed genes.  
   *The number of seed genes should be greater than ':eigen_max' (see 'Hyperparameters').*  
3. Seed genes start with letters.  
   *Gene symbols in the expression data should start with letters, therefore seed genes should also start with letters.*  
  
### Example Seed Genes
```
71-element Vector{String}:
 "ACOT4"
 "ACSM5"
 "ADORA1"
 "ADRB3"
 "ALAS1"
 "ANGPTL2"
 "ARHGAP20"
 "ARNTL"
 ⋮
 "TP53INP2"
 "TSC22D3"
 "TSPAN4"
 "TUSC5"
 "USP2"
 "WEE1"
 "ZEB2"
```
  
## 5. Covariates  
The expression data may contain rows of grouping variables (discontinuous covariates) or continuous variables (continuous covariates). The following constraints apply:  
  
1. All covariate rows must be above expression data.
2. Grouping variables (discontinous covariates) must start with letters.  
3. Continuous variables (continuous covariates) must **only** contain numbers.  
4. Within a row of grouping variables (discontinuous covariates), each group must contain at least two (2) or more samples.  
   *Consider sample tissue type as a covariate. If the data has 'Non Tumor' and 'Tumor' samples, there should be at least two (2) 'Non Tumor' and two (2) 'Tumor' samples in the data. Ideally, the number of samples in each group is greater than ':eigen_max' (see 'Hyperparameters').*  
5. All samples must have have values for **all** covariates (rows).  
6. Covariate rows must have unique names.  
7. Covariate rows have regex identifiers <ins>in the gene symbol column</ins>.  
   *The example below, discontinuous covariates end in '_D' and continuous covariates end in '_C'. See 'Hyperparameters.'*  
  
### Example Covariates
Below is a sample dataset with three (3) covariates and two (2) genes. Two (2) covariates are discontinuous ('tissueType_D' and 'site_D'), and one (1) is continuous ('age_C').
```
   Row │ Gene_Symbol   GTEX_1117F_2826_SM_5GZXL  GTEX_1122O_1226_SM_5H113  GTEX ⋯
───────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     1 │ tissueType_D  NonTumor                  Tumor                     NonT ⋯
     2 │ site_D        B1                        B1                        B1
     3 │ age_C         25                        56                        62
     4 │ GENE1         4.32                      27.63                     18.43
     5 │ GENE2         17.58                     21.42                     35.67
```
Note that the example expression data ('GENE1' & 'GENE2') are below all covariate rows (rows 1-3). No other covariates (ending in '_D' or '_C') should be present below 'GENE1.'  
  
## 6. Hyperparameters  
Hyperparameters are stored in a single dictionary to reduce the number of individual input arguments to the *CYCLOPS.Fit* and *CYCLOPS.Align* functions. Below is the default hyperparameter dictionary, including default values. It is not recommended to alter default values unless absolutely necessary. Any changes to the values of the hyperparameter dictionary will result in warnings printed to the REPL when running the *CYCLOPS.Fit* function.

```
  
### Hyperparameters without Default Values
Some parameters do not have default values. These parameters come in pairs, meaning that if one parameter is added to the hyperparameter dictionary, the other parameter must also be added.  
```julia
# Pair 1
:train_sample_id    # Array{Symbol, 1}. Sample ids for which collection times exist.  
:train_sample_phase # Array{Number, 1}. Collection times for each sample id. 'train_sample_id' and 'train_sample_phase' must be the same length.  
  
# Pair 2
:align_samples      # Array{String, 1}. Sample ids for which collection times exist.  
:align_phases       # Array{Number, 1}. Collection times for each sample id. 'align_samples' and 'align_phases' must be the same length.  
  
# Pair 3
:align_genes        # Array{String, 1}. Genes with known acrophases.  
:align_acrophases   # Array{Number, 1}. Acrophases for each gene. 'align_genes' and 'align_acrophases' must be the same length.  
```
  
## 7. Sample Collection Times  
Sample collection times may be provided and added to the hyperparameter dictionary. These may be used in two different ways:
1. Semi-supervised training.  
   *CYCLOPS optimizes the distance between predicted and provided sample collection times **while training** when sample ids and collection times are added via ':train_sample_id' and ':train_sample_phase'.*  
2. Post-training alignment.  
   *CYCLOPS predicted phases are aligned to sample collection times **after training** when added via ':align_samples' and ':algin_phases'.*  
  
':train_sample_phase' **must** be given in radians ($0 - 2\pi$), **NOT** hours. By default, ':align_phases' and ':align_acrophases' must be given in radians, but should you wish to provide hours, also set ':align_base => "hours"' in the hyperparameter dictionary (see 'Hyperparameters').  

## 8. CYCLOPS.Fit  
*CYCLOPS.Fit* has three (3) input arguments and five (5) outputs.
  
### Input Arguments
1. The expression data (as described in section 3),  
2. the seed genes (as described in section 4),  
3. and the hyperparameter dictionary (as described in section 6).  
  
### Outputs  
1. The eigen data,  
2. the sample fit,  
3. the eigen gene correlations,  
4. the trained model,  
5. and the updated hyperparameter dictionary.  
  
### Example Usage of CYCLOPS.Fit  
*CYCLOPS.Fit* may be used with a hyperparameter dictionary...
```julia
eigendata, samplefit, eigendatacorrelations, trainedmodel, updatedparameters = CYCLOPS.Fit(expressiondata, seedgenes, hyperparameters)
```
or without adding a hyperparameter dictionary. 
```julia
eigendata, samplefit, eigendatacorrelations, trainedmodel, updatedparameters = CYCLOPS.Fit(expressiondata, seedgenes)
```
When no hyperparameter dictionary is supplied as the third argument to *CYCLOPS.Fit*, the default values for all hyperparameters are used. Inspect the default hyperparameters using *CYCLOPS.DefaultDict*.
```julia
CYCLOPS.DefaultDict()
```
## 9. CYCLOPS.Align  
*CYCLOPS.Align* has six (6) input arguments and saves files to a directory (no outputs).  
  
### Inputs
1. the expression data (as described in section 3),  
2. the sample fit (second output of CYCLOPS.Fit),  
3. the eigen gene correlations (third output of CYCLOPS.Fit),  
4. the trained model (fourth output of CYCLOPS.Fit),  
5. the updated hyperparameter dictionary (fifth output of CYCLOPS.Fit),  
6. and the output path where results are saved.  
  
### Saved Files  
*CYCLOPS.Align* creates four (4) subdirectories:  
1. Models  
   *The CYCLOPS model with the lowest reconstruction*
2. Parameters  
   *The hyperparameter dictionary*
3. Plots  
   *Clock face and sample alignment plots*
4. Fits  
   *Sample phase predictions, eigen gene correlations, and cosinor regression results*
  
### Example Usage of CYCLOPS.Align  
  
```julia
CYCLOPS.Align(expressiondata, samplefit, eigendatacorrelations, trainedmodel, updatedparameters, outputpath)
```
  
### Why 'Align?'
CYCLOPS returns a relative ordering of all samples. Since a circle has no beginning, endpoint, or inherent direction, the raw predicted sample phases must in some way be aligned to the external world. There are three (3) possible ways to align the raw predicted sample phases:
1. to 17 core clock genes,
2. to genes of choice,
3. to known sample collection times.
  
The raw predicted sample phases are always aligned to the 17 core clock genes.
```julia
CYCLOPS.human_homologue_gene_symbol
CYCLOPS.mouse_acrophases
```
Using the raw predicted sample phases, cosinors of best fit are calculated for the 17 core clock genes. The cosinors of best fit tell us the predicted times at which transcripts are maximally expressed (transcript acrophases). The predicted transcript acrophases are aligned to 'CYCLOPS.mouse_acrophases.' Notably, predicted transcript acrophases are only compared for transcripts with a significant cosinor fit ($p < 0.05$).  
  
Genes of choice may be provided using ':align_genes' and ':align_acrophases' (see 'Hyperparameters'). As above, raw predicted sample phases are used to calculate cosinors of best fit, this time for the genes of choice. Predicted acrophases are aligned to ':align_acrophases' for transcripts with a significant fit ($p < 0.05$). *Please provide ':align_acrophases' in radians if ':align_base => "radians".'* (see 'Hyperparameters')  
  
If sample collection times are known for all (or a subset of) samples, these may be provided using ':align_samples' and ':align_phases' (see 'Hyperparameters'). Raw predicted sample phases are aligned to the provided known sample collection times. *Please provide ':align_phases' in radians if ':align_base => "radians".'* (see 'Hyperparameters')
